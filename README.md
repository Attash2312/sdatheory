## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

### CLO-1: Understanding
Understand the fundamental concepts of software architecture and design principles.

### CLO-2: Applying
Apply various architectural styles and patterns to solve design problems.

### CLO-3: Analyzing
Analyze and compare different architectural approaches and their trade-offs.

### CLO-4: Creating
Design software architectures using appropriate styles, patterns, and connectors.

## Study Tips
- Review each lecture's notes thoroughly
- Practice drawing the diagrams from memory
- Understand the relationships between different concepts
- Focus on scenario-based questions
- Practice identifying appropriate patterns for given situations
- Pay special attention to connector types and their applications

## Exam Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Understand all software design principles and difficulties
- [ ] Be able to draw and explain architecture diagrams
- [ ] Know the differences between various architectural styles
- [ ] Understand when to use different design patterns
- [ ] Practice scenario-based questions with diagrams
- [ ] Review all connector types and their classifications
- [ ] Understand the relationship between components and connectors
- [ ] Be able to select appropriate connectors for given scenarios

## File Organization
Each lecture folder contains:
- **Index file**: Main overview with links to all topic files
- **Topic files**: Individual files for each major topic or logical group
- **Practice questions**: Exam-focused questions with solutions and diagrams
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of concepts and architectures

## Success Tips
- **Practice drawing diagrams** regularly
- **Understand the "why"** behind each concept
- **Connect concepts** across lectures
- **Use real scenarios** to reinforce learning
- **Review practice questions** thoroughly
- **Focus on application** rather than memorization

Good luck with your exam preparation! ðŸš€
