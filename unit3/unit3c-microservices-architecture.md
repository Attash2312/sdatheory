# Unit 3C: Microservices Architecture

## 1. What is Microservices Architecture?
Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a suite of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating via lightweight mechanisms (often HTTP APIs). Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## 2. Key Characteristics

### 2.1 Service Independence
- Each service can be developed and deployed independently
- Services can use different technologies and programming languages
- Independent scaling based on demand
- Fault isolation - failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system

### 2.2 Business Capability Focus
- Services are organized around business capabilities
- Each service handles a specific domain or function
- Clear boundaries between services
- Domain-driven design principles

### 2.3 Decentralized Data Management
- Each service owns its data
- No shared database between services
- Data consistency through eventual consistency
- Polyglot persistence (different databases for different services)

### 2.4 Resilience and Scalability
- Services can fail independently
- Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- Horizontal scaling of individual services
- Load balancing and service discovery

### 2.5 Technology Diversity
- Freedom to choose the best technology for each service
- Polyglot programming and persistence
- Independent technology evolution
- Best-of-breed technology selection

    C->>A: HTTP Request
    A->>S: Forward Request
    S->>A: Response
    A->>C: HTTP Response
```

### 5.2 Asynchronous Communication (Message Queues)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S1 as Service 1
    participant MQ as Message Queue
    participant S2 as Service 2
    
    S1->>MQ: Publish Message
    MQ->>S2: Consume Message
    S2->>MQ: Acknowledge
```
