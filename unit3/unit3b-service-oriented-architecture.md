# Unit 3B: Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## 1. What is Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)?
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style where software components (services) provide functionality to other components over a network. Each service is independent, reusable, and loosely coupled. SOA enables organizations to integrate existing systems and build new applications by combining services.

## 2. Key Principles of SOA

### 2.1 Loose Coupling
- Services interact with minimal dependencies
- Changes in one service don't affect others
- Services can be modified independently

### 2.2 Reusability
- Services are designed for reuse in different contexts
- Business logic is encapsulated in services
- Reduces development time and cost

### 2.3 Interoperability
- Services use standard protocols (HTTP, SOAP, REST)
- Platform and language independent
- Enables integration of heterogeneous systems

### 2.4 Discoverability
- Services can be found and used by others
- Service registry maintains service descriptions
- Self-describing services

### 2.5 Composability
- Services can be combined to create new applications
- Orchestration and choreography patterns
- Business process automation

## 3. SOA Architecture Components

    B --> C[Service Implementation]
    C --> D[Database]
    B --> E[Service Registry]
    F[Service Bus] --> B
    G[Orchestration Engine] --> F
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
    style G fill:#fff8e1
```

## 4. SOA Layers

### 4.1 Consumer Layer
- Applications that consume services
- User interfaces, mobile apps, web applications
- Initiates service requests

### 4.2 Process Layer
- Business process orchestration
- Workflow management
- Service composition

### 4.3 Service Layer
- Business services
- Technical services
- Data services

### 4.4 Integration Layer
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
- Message routing and transformation
- Protocol mediation

### 4.5 Data Layer
- Databases, file systems
- Legacy systems
- External data sources

## 5. SOA vs Microservices Comparison

| Aspect | SOA | Microservices |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| **Service Size** | Large, coarse-grained | Small, fine-grained |
| **Data Storage** | Shared databases | Independent databases |
| **Communication** | ESB, SOAP, REST | REST, gRPC, messaging |
| **Deployment** | Monolithic deployment | Independent deployment |
| **Technology** | Heterogeneous | Homogeneous |
| **Governance** | Centralized | Decentralized |

## 6. SOA Implementation Patterns

### 6.1 Service Registry Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service Provider] --> B[Service Registry]
    C[Service Consumer] --> B
    C --> D[Service Provider]
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

### 6.2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Service A] --> B[ESB]
    C[Service B] --> B
    D[Service C] --> B
    B --> E[Service D]
    B --> F[Service E]
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
```

### 6.3 Orchestration Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Orchestrator] --> B[Service 1]
    A --> C[Service 2]
    A --> D[Service 3]
    B --> A
    C --> A
    D --> A
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
```

## 7. Real-World Examples

### 7.1 University Management System
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Student Portal] --> B[Student Service]
    A --> C[Course Service]
    A --> D[Payment Service]
    B --> E[Student Database]
    C --> F[Course Database]
    D --> G[Payment Gateway]
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
    style G fill:#fff8e1
```

**Services:**
- **Student Service**: Manages student information, enrollment
- **Course Service**: Handles course catalog, scheduling
- **Payment Service**: Processes fees, refunds
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS

### 7.2 Food Delivery Platform
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer App] --> B[Order Service]
    A --> C[Restaurant Service]
    A --> D[Payment Service]
    B --> E[Order Database]
    C --> F[Restaurant Database]
    D --> G[Payment Gateway]
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
    style F fill:#f1f8e9
    style G fill:#fff8e1
```
