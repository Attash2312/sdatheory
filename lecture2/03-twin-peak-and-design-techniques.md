# Twin Peak Model and Design Techniques

## The Twin Peak Model
The Twin Peak Model shows the relationship between requirements and architecture. The two "peaks" represent requirements analysis and architectural design, and the process is iterativeâ€”each influences the other.

**Diagram: Twin Peak Model**

```

## Design and Architecture
- Design is the process of creating a solution to a problem.
- Architecture is the high-level structure that guides design decisions.
- Good architecture enables good design.

## Architecture-Centric Design
- Design decisions are guided by architectural principles.
- Architecture provides constraints and guidelines for design.
- Ensures consistency and coherence across the system.

## Design Techniques
### Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
- Organizes software around objects that contain data and behavior.
- Principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

**Diagram: Object-Oriented Design**
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +name: String
        +makeSound() void
    }
    class Dog {
        +makeSound() void
    }
    class Cat {
        +makeSound() void
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

#### Pros and Cons of OOD
**Pros:**
- Encapsulation and information hiding
- Reusability through inheritance
- Polymorphism for flexibility
- Natural modeling of real-world entities

**Cons:**
- Can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies
- Performance overhead
- Not suitable for all problem domains

### DSSA - Domain-Specific Software Architecture
- Architecture tailored to a specific application domain.
- Captures common patterns and solutions for that domain.
- Examples: banking systems, e-commerce platforms, healthcare systems.

    C --> D[Domain-Specific Components]
    D --> E[Applications]
```

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Twin Peak Model
**Question:** Explain the Twin Peak Model and draw a diagram to illustrate the relationship between requirements analysis and architectural design.

**Solution:**
- The Twin Peak Model shows that requirements analysis and architectural design are iterative and influence each other.
- See the diagram above.

### Question 2: OOD Pros and Cons
**Question:** List two pros and two cons of object-oriented design. Give an example where OOD is beneficial.

**Solution:**
- Pros: Encapsulation, reusability
- Cons: Complex hierarchies, performance overhead
- Example: OOD is beneficial in a simulation system where real-world entities are modeled as objects.

### Question 3: DSSA Example
**Question:** What is DSSA? Provide an example of a domain-specific software architecture.

**Solution:**
- DSSA is an architecture tailored to a specific domain, capturing common patterns and solutions.
- Example: An e-commerce platform with reusable components for shopping cart, payment, and inventory management.
