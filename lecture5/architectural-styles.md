## Overview
Lecture 5 explores various architectural styles and patterns used in software design. This lecture covers fundamental architectural approaches including object-oriented design, layered architectures, and client-server patterns, with detailed examples using the Lunar Lander case study.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand different architectural styles and their characteristics
- Apply architectural patterns to design problems
- Analyze trade-offs between different architectural approaches
- Use UML diagrams to represent architectural designs

## Architectural Styles Covered

### 1. Object-Oriented Style
- **Principles**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Benefits**: Modularity, reusability, maintainability
- **Clean Code**: Writing readable and maintainable code
- **Lunar Lander Example**: OO implementation with classes and objects

### 2. Layered Architecture
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization of components
- **Virtual Machines**: Abstraction layers and system virtualization
- **Benefits**: Separation of concerns, modularity, testability
- **Lunar Lander Example**: Layered implementation with clear boundaries

### 3. Client-Server Architecture
- **Pattern**: Distributed computing with client and server roles
- **Communication**: Network-based interaction between components
- **Benefits**: Scalability, resource sharing, centralized management
- **Lunar Lander Example**: Multiplayer implementation with network considerations

## Study Tips
- **Compare styles**: Understand when to use each architectural approach
- **Practice UML**: Draw diagrams to visualize architectures
- **Consider trade-offs**: Every style has advantages and disadvantages
- **Apply to scenarios**: Use Lunar Lander examples to understand concepts

## Practice Questions
Each topic file includes:
- Conceptual questions about architectural styles
- UML diagramming exercises
- Scenario-based design problems
- Analysis of architectural trade-offs

## Key Concepts

### Architectural Style Properties
- **Components**: What are the main computational elements?
- **Connectors**: How do components communicate?
- **Constraints**: What rules govern the architecture?
- **Benefits**: What advantages does this style provide?

### Style Selection Criteria
- **Functional requirements**: What must the system do?
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, scalability, maintainability
- **Technical constraints**: Platform, language, infrastructure
- **Organizational factors**: Team skills, development process

## Next Steps
After completing Lecture 5, you should be able to:
1. Identify and apply appropriate architectural styles
2. Design systems using object-oriented and layered approaches
3. Create UML diagrams for architectural designs
4. Evaluate trade-offs between different architectural choices
